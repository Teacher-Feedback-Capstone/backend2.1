Teacher: Good morning, class. Today, we’re learning about photosynthesis. Can anyone tell me what photosynthesis is?

Student 1: Uh, is it when plants eat food?

Teacher: Not quite. Photosynthesis is when plants use sunlight to make food. (Pauses) Okay, so plants take in sunlight, water, and…um…carbon dioxide, and they produce oxygen and…um…sugar. Does that make sense?

Student 2: Kind of. Is it like when we eat candy for energy?

Teacher: Hmm…sort of, but plants don’t eat candy. They make their own energy. (Smiles awkwardly) Anyway, let’s move on. Can someone name the parts of a plant involved in photosynthesis?

Student 1: The leaves?

Teacher: Yes! Good. The leaves are like tiny factories. Anything else?

Student 2: Roots?

Teacher: Uh, not really. (Pauses) Actually, roots just absorb water. The main parts for photosynthesis are the leaves and, um, the chloroplasts inside them. (Writes “Chloroplasts” on the board but spells it “Cloroplasts.”) Let’s keep going.

Teacher: So, plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. What do they produce? Anyone remember?

Student 1: Oxygen!

Teacher: Yes! And…something else? (Looks at notes) Sugar! They make glucose, which is a type of sugar. (Turns to board and writes “Oxygen + Sugar”).

Student 2: How do they make sugar?

Teacher: Uh…well, it’s a chemical process called the Calvin Cycle, but we won’t go into details. It’s…complicated. (Glances at clock) Let’s just focus on sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Student 1: Do all plants do this? Like, even cacti?

Teacher: (Hesitates) Um, yes, all plants photosynthesize, but cacti might do it a little differently. They use a process called CAM photosynthesis…um, but let’s not get sidetracked.

Student 2: So, do they need sunlight all the time?

Teacher: Hmm…plants need sunlight during the day, but they don’t use it at night. At night, they do something called respiration. (Pauses) Well, we’re getting off-topic. Let’s go back to the basics.

Student 1: What’s respiration?

Teacher: Uh…we’ll cover that another day. (Moves quickly to another topic) Alright, let’s do an activity. I want you to draw a plant and label where photosynthesis happens. (Hands out worksheets)

Student 2: Can we work together?

Teacher: Hmm…no, this is individual work. But you can ask me if you’re stuck.

Student 1: (Raises hand) Do we have to color it?

Teacher: No, just label it. (Glances at clock) Okay, we have five minutes. Get started.

Student 2: (After a minute) I don’t get this. What’s a chloroplast again?

Teacher: It’s the thing in the leaves that helps with photosynthesis. (Points vaguely at the board) I wrote it here.

Student 2: But it’s spelled wrong.

Teacher: (Frowns) Oh. Um…okay. Just fix it on your paper.
